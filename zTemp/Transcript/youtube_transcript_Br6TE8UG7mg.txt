what's going on Zena here own the
present shift your identity dominate
your reality I want to let you know
right now one
thing your dream life that Ultimate
Reality that you want to be experiencing
is about to become a fact if you make
that
choice if you make that choice for
yourself and you can do a simple little
technique it's just a couple of phases
that is going to shift everything in
your life because until I did this I got
to tell you nothing was working in my
life my life was an absolute disaster
and if I can do it at
42 listen anybody can do
this stepping into a conscious version
of yourself and making that a choice for
yourself and
recognizing that you are not this old
story that you are not this narrative
and all of these beliefs that were given
to you that were not your
choice this is not who you are
this is not who you are and you're about
to be free of it you're about to free
yourself from this
burden and you know what the other night
I was riding home from Olympia
Stadium I still do some work there when
the soccer is on and I'm on my gravel
bike in a forest just like this right
it's dark it's night time and I'm riding
on my bike in the middle of this forest
in
Germany and the clouds were gone like
you could see the stars and the moon and
I looked up and I was I just let go of
the
handlebars and I looked up at the sky
and I was just so grateful so grateful
for this transformation so grateful that
after all of the
years of living in darkness in despair
running around in circles feeling like a
hamster in a
wheel this was never possible for me
this was not even a possibility for over
25 years so whoever you are what
wherever you are at in your life I'm
telling you that if you shift how you
see yourself your concept of self that
is governing how you behave and what you
attract and how you live you can live
whatever life you want to be
experiencing it is about to become
yours so just do this simple exercise
with me for just one
moment and imagine just imagine for a
moment come into the present moment let
everything else go come back to
zero the purity of your being right
right here right now and imagine your
dream
life yeah your desired
life what does that look like what does
your dream life look like if everything
had just worked out
perfectly wherever you're living
relationships how you're feeling you've
got an amazing connection to life life
to the
universe maybe you're doing something
super creative you know you've got this
business going however this picture
looks I want you to Envision this for
just a moment use that
creativity use that incredible
imagination of
yours because we're getting to reverse
engineer your dream life right now once
you have that General picture in mind
don't worry about
how ask yourself this question and this
is what changed my whole life
this is this is exactly what will change
your life it's guaranteed to happen who
is living that life who is living that
life what version of yourself is living
that
life what concept of yourself is living
that
life how you speaking to yourself how do
you see yourself how do you look
physically because the what and the when
is not going to get you to your
destination The Vessel and the means
that is going to make everything become
available starting right now is who is
doing
them who your concept of
self when that becomes your own design
and you start living from the end State
when you start being
everything and you are everything you
looking for and you are that version of
yourself living that dream life one day
at a time and you start handing your
faith and trust to the present moment
your
subconscious because it's been guiding
the ship the whole time everything is
about to become
available see your ideal life understand
it's about to be yours and make sure you
say this to
yourself because you know life
whatever you want to call this thing
Christ Consciousness life the truth the
present moment pure awareness Buddha
nature Allah God I don't care I don't
care about being right being philos
philosophical I don't care about looking
wise I don't care about any of that
stuff all I care is about all I care
about is me sharing what happened in my
life how I made this transformation and
how you can do the same for yourself
whatever you want to call this thing
life the universe it has your back you
need to understand this everything that
you are giving it everything that you
are giving it in the present moment your
feelings the images the beliefs your
assumptions your past
experiences everything is being absorbed
right there in the present moment and
that is consistently recreating how you
see the world how you see life what
comes into your life what you accept
what you repel and you don't have any
choice currently what is happening
because you've already planted those
seeds long ago and this is what you reap
this is what I reap every single day
until I recognized
this I kept trying to change my life
change my
circumstances not recognizing that I was
living through an unconscious narrative
my whole life feeding the subconscious
that I'm not wealthy not healthy I'm not
any of these things I'm not there
yet but recognize this truth today and
realize you've done it one way now
consciously do it the other way from
today onwards you are absolutely
incredible you are amazing you are full
of creativity and wisdom and kindness
and appreciation start feeling those
things start seeing those things as part
of who you are and you're saying to
yourself you know what that dream life
it is mine
it's on its way thank you I'll have it
because the universe it responds to
faith and trust to feeling and knowing
it does not respond very well to wanting
and striving and looking and searching
and not being
sure you are everything you're looking
for you've got it all already so reverse
engineer your dream life see the outcome
see that Vision it is yours it's on its
way and then step into that version of
yourself that is already living it bring
it into the present moment absorb and
say this is who I am I accept from now
on I'm going to live one day at a time
as my highest
version and once you recognize that and
once you start stepping into that then
go ahead and have a look at your day if
you are that what time do you get up in
the morning if you are that are you
training every day if you are that are
you journaling every day if you are that
are you visualizing every day if you are
that are you asking those are you using
those ask formations the questions you
ask determines the outcome of the game
what behaviors and what habits do you
have if you're living as that version
living that life this is your bread and
butter and make it fun make it
creative have a blast be the most
kindest most wel welcoming most lovely
person to yourself have an amazing
relationship relationship with yourself
that is your conscious choice that is
completely your choice so fill yourself
up with the feelings of kindness
appreciation strength wisdom abundance
because it's all yours
anyway and as you start moving through
life is
that one day at a time watch how
suddenly life goes oh yeah this is who
you are okay here are some brand new
circumstances brand new people are going
to start walking your life brand new
situations will come into your orbit and
you'll have no idea where they're coming
from because you've you've planted those
seeds every single day every single day
you're planting conscious seeds of
wealth of health of kindness
appreciation and you're taking ownership
you're saying yes thank you I know I'm
worthy of everything and that dream life
of mine it's on it way it's a done
deal and start living as that one day at
a time watch Magic unfold in your
life you are magical you are
incredible I got goosebumps right
now and this is magical and when you
decide to live consciously I understand
it's not always easy I know what it's
like and I know there's been plenty of
comments what about my family what about
my friends what about my social
surroundings they keep dragging me
down do you know what when you make that
choice and you realize that you have to
be it all first and you start living one
day at a time as that you become
non-negotiable you become somebody that
holds themselves to their own
word because that's what you need to be
doing you got to have so much confidence
so much confidence that you're going to
stop worrying and thinking and judging
others because you know why because you
stop worrying thinking and judging
yourself because people around you and
the way they act it's a reflection of
how you see
yourself I'm wishing you a fantastic
day please comment I'll respond if you'd
