What's going on? Zena here. Own the
present. Shift your identity. Transform
your
reality. Your whole life is about to
change. Everything you
experience and whatever is happening,
it's all going to
shift when you realize that your
imagination is the key to everything.
And we have imagined
ourselves to be
somebody. And when you finally make that
choice, the only choice to
make when you come back to that
place to zero to right here and right
now and choose to live as somebody using
your imagination now consciously that is
your choice, your design, your creation,
not your past, not thoughts, beliefs and
assumptions that we believe to be true
about ourselves, about life, about this
world, about what is
possible. And when you make that
shift for the first time in your life,
and realize that your imagination
creates everything into
existence through how you see
yourself, who you believe yourself to
be. And when you shed the skin of an
unconscious version that was not your
choice and then you create your very own
realizing that that is the
vehicle. That is the hub through which
everything flows in terms of what you
do, how you do them, the circumstances,
what you attract, all of it.
There is in fact only one thing that is
true, real, everlasting, which is
you. You are this
truth. You are the purity of
consciousness, the present moment,
Christ consciousness right here, right
now.
And we are all told a
story of our own separateness that we
are
somebody. And
depending on what we filled the cup with
unconsciously, that determines
everything in this game called life.
And when you consciously choose using
your imagination to play the game of
life as a character as a somebody that
is already everything you're looking for
and you start feeling and knowing
yourself to be that your subconscious
that's going to take it all
on just like this old version but now it
is your
choice. Now you use your mind, your
imagination consciously with feeling and
conviction and paint that amazing
picture internally and saying this is
who I am from now
on. I am the end
product. And that is why you have to use
your imagination which creates
everything in terms of your
experience to your advantage. realizing
that this is your godly
power and it is here for a
reason. If we didn't have our
imagination, we couldn't create things
into existence. We needed to experience
the highs and lows of life and all of
it. Even Albert Einstein
right with his mind he said without his
imagination he couldn't have come up
with the answers to the theory of
relativity and all of that
stuff. So who would you be right now?
Who are you going to step into the shoes
of? If you could consciously choose
right now using that amazing imagination
of yours, who would you step into the
shoes of? How would you feel knowing
yourself to be everything you're looking
for? Because that is what's going to
create that brand new reality cuz you
have to be it first. I went to
sleep for 25 years as somebody that was
my past. Thoughts and beliefs that were
not empowering me. Situations and
circumstances and experiences that I
kept repeating in my mind, saying
unconsciously, "This is who I am. This
is who I am. I'm limited. I'm not there
yet. I'm not financially free. This is
not who I am. I'm on a journey. I'm
still going. I'm still looking. I'm
still searching.
Right? Lacking
selfworth. Never treating myself with
love, kindness, and
respect. And that is who I imagined
myself to be for a
lifetime. I woke up as that. I walked
through life as
that. And maybe you can feel and relate
to this.
I was not happy with myself with how
life had turned out. So I kept trying to
change
outside not realizing that inside
creates outside in terms of your
experience, what you attract, how you
behave, your
habits, what you actually
see. Once those smoke screens and those
veils and those barriers leave your
consciousness because you are no longer
feeding it with an identity, a version
of yourself that is creating all of
these
things. Suddenly you can see whatever
needs to be
seen. Absolutely
amazing. and the circumstances what
needs to come into your life for you to
live a life of abundance of wealth being
incredibly healthy, joyful experiences,
relationships, being your
highest. It all becomes available when
you become available to it.
We have to energetically align ourselves
with wealth, with health, with joy and
abundance right now and imagine
ourselves to be that one day at a
time. That's why I say download those
asations, the questions we ask ourselves
with feeling and knowing and build the
most incredible relationship with
yourself internally, with your
subconscious Christ consciousness.
We have imagined ourselves to be
somebody unconsciously that created
everything into existence, especially
our problems and
issues. Now use that very imagination,
that gift that you've been
given to live as that version starting
right now. That is already what you're
looking for. And then you'll start to
see it and come into contact with it and
make the right choices. I was making
choices from fear, from limitation, from
wanting, grasping, looking, searching
because I was saying this is not who I
am. I need those things. And that's why
they eluded me cuz that was my
reality. Create your own inner reality
of abundance, of wealth, of
health, joy, and peace, saying, "This is
who I am." And feed that to your
subconscious one day at a time. Fall
asleep as that. Wake up as that. Use
your imagination to your advantage.
Watch your life
transform. You are life pushed out. That
is why 99% of people always look outside
for the answers, not realizing that they
are the answer. That's why you go inside
first. Be it, feel it, know it. Start
living as
that. And then watch as outside starts
showing you your inner reflection and
what needs to happen and all of
it. Just one day at a time. Use your
imagination. Go all in. Be the king, the
goddess of your inner
world. I'm wishing you guys a fantastic
day.
