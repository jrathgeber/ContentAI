One of the most fundamental physics facts is 
that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant  
for all observers. But can we really be sure that 
the speed of light wasn’t different in the past,  
or perhaps in other parts of the universe? In 
fact, variable speed of light theories have long  
been used to try to explain everything 
from dark energy to gravity itself.  
So let’s explore how constant this 
fundamental constant really is.
Speed is relative. Drop your smoothie on a 
train and it appears to fall straight down,  
but to me standing on the platform 
the smoothie falls diagonally,  
apparently boosted by the speed of the train. But 
shine a laser beam from the train and everyone  
observes the same speed—299,792,458 m/s in 
a vacuum, no matter their relative speeds.
The invariance of the speed of light is 
more precisely described by something  
called Lorentz invariance, and it’s the 
founding axiom of special relativity.  
Einstein realized that our measurements 
of distance and time have to be relative  
to the observer—they have to shift to keep 
the speed of light the same for everyone.  
This same axio m is also fundamental to 
general relativity, in which gravity is  
interpreted as a warping of the fabric of
spacetime. Both special and general  
relativity have been tested with extreme care and 
precision over and over and have never failed.  
More to the point, the speed of light has 
been measured in different reference frames  
and its invariance holds down to the 
exquisite precision of current methods.
That said, we scientists are supposed to remain 
simultaneously skeptical and open minded—somehow  
applying both mindsets to both old and new 
theories. So in that spirit let’s ask whether the  
speed of light is really invariant. For example, 
could it change over time, or be different in  
different parts of the universe? There are some 
who believe that the very effects that relativity  
predicts are due to the speed of light changing, 
not due to changes in space and time themselves.
Now before I start talking about what it 
means for the speed of light to change,  
I want to make it clear why many, and perhaps most 
physicists think that it’s not only impossible,  
but it’s not even meaningful to think 
about a variable speed of light.
The speed of light isn’t really about light. 
It’s the speed of any massless particle,  
and also the maximum speed that information 
can travel. It’s the speed of causality. It’s  
the rate at which one point in space 
can communicate with its neighbors,  
assuming no impediments. So to change the speed 
of light, we’d need to change something pretty  
fundamental about the universe—the 
connection between space and time.
We measure speed in terms of the amount 
of distance traveled per unit of time,  
whether that’s miles per hour or 
meters per second. Changing the  
speed of light means changing the number 
of meters it can travel every second.  
The problem with this is that our very definition 
of meters and of seconds are tied to the speed of  
light. We can think of the meter as the distance 
light travels in 1-over-300 million seconds. Or  
we can think of the second as how long it 
takes light to travel 300 million meters.
Einstein said that “time is what clocks measure”,  
which we can interpret as meaning that it’s a 
measure of the rate of change of the universe.  
One of Einstein’s thought experiments was 
the photon clock, in which he imagined a  
photon bouncing between two mirrors, and each 
2-way trip indicates the tick of the clock.  
What happens if we slow the speed of light? The 
clock ticks more slowly, which means time slows.
Now real clocks are made of gears or 
electronics which are made of atoms which  
are made of various quantum oscillations bound 
up in ways analogous to the photon clock—whether  
electrons communicating virtual photons with 
the nucleus, or quarks exchanging gluons in  
that nucleus. This argument applies for any 
object with mass—the speed of light dictates  
the rate of internal change, which determines 
the rate of the flow of time for all matter.
So if slowing light also slows time, would we 
even notice? Not according to special relativity,  
in which space and time are fundamentally 
coupled—two sides of the same coin.  
Changing the speed of light slows time, and 
moving the mirrors further apart also slows  
time. In this picture, distance, time, 
and the speed of light scale together,  
so on our scale there’s no observable 
effect. The speed of light is just the unit  
conversion factor between our arbitrary 
choices of spatial and temporal units.
The only way for a change in the speed of 
light to do anything is if time and space  
both have their own fundamental units that are 
independent of each other. If there’s a basic  
smallest unit of space and a smallest unit of 
time, and these don’t depend on the other, then  
maybe changing the speed of light would change the 
relationship between space and time, at least on  
the quantum scale. So let’s imagine that this 
is possible and explore the consequences.
The first real “variable speed of light” or "VSL" 
theory was proposed by Robert Dicke back in 1957.  
Dicke was a brilliant physicist and astronomer 
with wide-ranging contributions, so we should  
at least pay attention to his musings. Dicke 
wondered if gravitational fields might not be  
due to the bending of spacetime, but instead due 
to the speed of light slowing down near massive  
objects. Remember that light changes its direction 
as it moves into a medium where its speed is  
lower—that’s exactly how lenses work. So why 
not gravity too? And we know that time does tick  
slower in a gravitational field. And we now know 
that slowing the speed of light should slow time.  
It seems like a variable speed of light could 
be an elegant alternative hypothesis, no?
No. Back in 1957 there were only a few 
successful tests of general relativity,  
and some of those were consistent with either 
spacetime curvature or a changing speed of light.
But nowadays we know that spacetime itself must 
be dynamic—we’ve measured how rotating masses  
drag space around, and how colliding black holes 
generate gravitational waves, none of which work  
with the variable speed of light interpretation. 
Dicke’s idea was intriguing, but it doesn’t stand  
up to the latest evidence. And given that 
evidence, Dicke himself would surely agree.
OK, so maybe a variable speed of light doesn’t 
explain all of gravity. But could it still play  
a part? There’s one weird fact about our universe 
that could possibly be explained by this idea. If  
we look at the edge of the observable universe in 
that direction we see the warm, smooth gas that  
existed before any stars or galaxies formed. 
We see exactly the same in that direction,  
or that, or that. The universe at early times 
was extremely homogeneous—almost the same  
density and temperature everywhere. That tells 
us that at some point in the distant past all  
of that material had to have been in contact 
in order to distribute energy and settle into  
the same state. But the problem is, based on the 
observed rate of expansion of the universe, there  
just wasn’t time since the Big Bang for those 
regions to have communicated with each other.
We’ve talked about this so called "horizon 
problem" previously, along with the  
mainstream solution of cosmic inflation.
Inflation hypothesizes that at some very  
early time those distant regions were 
in causal contact with each other,  
enabling them to share energy at regular light 
speed and reach the same temperature. But then  
the universe underwent a period of extremely 
rapid expansion much faster than the speed  
of light before slowing dramatically. This 
threw apart regions that were close enough  
to be in thermal equilibrium so far apart that 
it appears now as if they could never have been.
But there is another way to 
bring those distant points into  
causal contact—and that’s by having light just 
move faster in the past. This could have kept  
the early universe connected as it expanded and 
reached uniformity. Then, if light slowed down  
to the current much slower speed, distant 
regions would seem causally disconnected.
And if this story is right, it could even 
be that the speed of light has been gently  
decreasing ever since. It has been suggested that 
this could explain why many galaxies appear to  
be accelerating away from us. Since light is 
supposedly becoming slower it's taking longer  
and longer for their light to reach us, giving 
the appearance that they are accelerating away  
from us. That may sound good, but variable speed 
of light theories don’t have a good explanation  
for why lightspeed would change in the very 
particular way needed to mimic both inflation  
and dark energy. Cosmic inflation seems a little 
cleaner, and is certainly better accepted.
The first effort to explain the horizon problem 
with a variable speed of light was by John Moffat  
in 1992. He proposed that the speed of light 
may have been 10^30 m/s in the early universe.  
Moffat lays out some substantial theoretical 
work, involving symmetry breaking - analogous  
to the one that separated the electromagnetic 
and weak forces. But in this case the broken  
symmetry was Lorentz invariance. Moffat’s theory 
preserved Lorentz invariance on relatively small  
scales—like across the galaxy—but allowed 
it to vary over cosmological distances and  
times. Another similar idea came from 
Andreas Albrecht and Joao Magueijo.
And yet another VSL model depends 
on the energy of light—higher  
energy photons would move faster. Perhaps then 
the ultra-high energy photons near the big  
bang did travel fast enough to connect 
distant points of the universe. Then,  
as the universe cooled, those high energy 
photons became rare and so light slowed down.  
Now we have absolutely never observed speed 
differences for lights of different energies
at any energy we’ve detected, and 
that includes comparing the arrival  
times of high energy gamma ray light from 
gamma ray bursts with the arrival times  
of lower energy light from the same 
explosions. But maybe the effect only  
kicks in at the really ridiculously 
high energies near the big bang.
These are fun ideas, but are they testable 
given that VSL theories predict the same  
thing as more standard ideas in 
general relativity? Well, there's 
another way to look for changes in the speed 
of light. And that by its effects on physics.  
“c” appears everywhere in our laws of physics—for 
example in the fine structure constant,  
which defines the strength of electromagnetism. 
The formula for alpha includes the charge of  
the electron, the electric permittivity of the 
vacuum, Planck's constant, and the speed of light.  
We’ve talked about this important 
constant of nature in the past,  
and even about whether it may have changed over 
time. Well, if the speed of light has changed  
then you’d expect the fine structure constant 
to change with it. And guess what—there’s no  
evidence of such a change. You can see our 
previous episode for that lack of evidence.
None of this proves that the speed 
of light has never varied—it just  
says it can’t have varied much 
over the past billions of years.  
But the real challenge for VSL theories 
is how they seem to break physics.
All VSL theories break Lorentz Invariance, 
and Lorentz Invariance seems pretty important  
for the universe to make sense. Remember the 
example about the smoothie from the beginning  
of the video? In that example you and I had 
a different interpretation of the same event,  
and yet, we both would agree 
on every aspect that mattered,  
like the fact that the smoothie hits 
the floor at a particular location,  
or that it hits the floor after it's 
dropped rather than before it's dropped.
The basic self consistency of the universe and 
the causal ordering of events is ensured under  
Lorentz invariance. Break it and it’s pretty 
easy to come up with nonsensical scenarios in  
which different observers have irreconcilable 
disagreements about the outcomes of events.
A variable speed of light also breaks 
the fundamental charge-parity-time  
or CPT symmetry of the universe, 
in that the laws of physics look  
fundamentally different depending on 
which direction of time you're moving.  
We’ve discussed CPT symmetry before. This 
is also problematic because CPT symmetry  
is believed to be truly fundamental, and 
we have no other evidence of it breaking.
There are ways around some of these objections. 
For example, we can imagine that the change in  
the speed of light is not exactly fundamental, 
but more akin to how that speed changes in a  
dense medium like water. So what if the 
refractive index of the universe changed  
over time? Well, that increase in the thickness 
of the vacuum would have to be pretty enormous  
in order to slow light by the factor of 
10^22 needed to solve the horizon problem.  
And that change appears to affect all light-speed 
waves equally—all frequencies of light,  
as well as gravitational waves. Regular materials 
don’t behave like this. Still, it is a sort of way  
out. And there are some other narrow paths 
through the dense network of refutations  
of VSL theories. However you need to be pretty 
committed to these ideas to find these ways out.
Currently there’s no evidence that the 
speed of light varies in a fundamental way,  
and it may be that it’s not even a meaningful 
concept. Although that latter point depends on an  
understanding of the quantum nature of space and 
time and their relationship to each other that we  
don’t yet have. It’s absolutely worth going back 
and questioning the founding axioms of even our  
most successful theories, as long as we keep in 
mind that any new theory is going to have to do  
just as well or better than the old one in all 
of its predictions. And that’s a tall order when  
you’re trying to break relativity, which has such 
deep internal consistency and is so powerfully  
predictive. But relativity is not the final 
theory due to its clash with quantum mechanics,  
so do let’s keep questioning it. Including 
whether the cosmic speed limit is fixed,  
or we can somehow change how fast 
information travels though spacetime.
So we missed one or two comment 
responses recently. Actually,  
we missed six. It’s my fault - there’s been 
a lot going on, including too much travel,  
and these responses actually take a lot of 
thought. So today we’re going back and doing  
responses for a selection of the missed episodes. 
We’ll do one comment from each of these, but we’ll  
do each very fully. We’ll also do them out of 
order. We have the superfluid episode, the one  
about turning the Sun in to a spaceship, the one 
about detecting planet-sized spaceships with LIGO,  
and then the one about when and how terrible or 
awesome the next nearby supernova is likely to be.
Before we jump into that, I also need to 
note a correction for our episode on the  
model of the proton interior. We talked about 
the important contributions of Stan Brodsky  
from the Stanford Linear Accelerator, but 
managed to use a picture of the wrong Stan  
Brodsky. Apologies to both Stans. THis is 
the Stan Brodsky we meant to shout out..
OK, finally to the comments, and starting 
with superfluids. Here’s an insightful  
comment on our episode on superfluids. 
Martinstent5339 suggests that it would  
be impossible to stir up a superfluid into a 
vortex because the fluid would just slip around  
the spoon rather than being pushed into 
a flow. There’s some good intuition here,  
but the conclusion is not quite right. The 
spoon does impart energy to the fluid—after all,  
the helium atoms have to move if they can’t pass 
through the spoon. And those moving atoms push on  
other atoms, so you do get a new flow which can 
translate to a rotation if the spoon is stirring.  
The point of the superfluid love moving 
in unison—in streamline flows, and the  
vortex is such a flow. What superfluids hate is 
atom-to-atom-level exchanges of random chunks  
of energy—they hate dissipative interactions 
which translate to friction, heat buildup,  
and viscous motion. However, as I mentioned in 
that video, it is possible to induce a sort of  
emergent viscosity by creating tiny vortices 
in the superfluid which then interact with  
each other in a way that disrupts viscous 
flow. That happens due to interaction with  
a non-perfectly smooth container wall, but 
stirring with a spoon should do some of that.
Let’s move on to the episode where we described 
ways to move the entire Sun to different galactic  
orbits. SABRMatt2010 has a major problem with 
the claim that the planets in a star's orbit  
would just come along for the ride when 
thrusting a star because it would create  
a momentary imbalance in the field that could 
destabilize carefully tuned orbital resonances.  
So you’re absolutely right that moving 
the Sun wouldn’t drag the planets along  
with literally zero effect. Moving the Sun a 
very tiny amount changes the center of mass of  
the solar system and the orbits would have to 
shift. If that change was tiny they’d quickly  
find a new stable orbit not much different 
to their last and still close to resonance.  
If the Sun keeps moving, but moves slowly compared 
to the amount of time it takes to recover orbital  
resonance, then the Sun could be moved without 
disrupting the planets. But if you try to move  
the Sun too quickly then yeah, you could break the 
solar system. Fortunatley, the proposed methods do  
move the Sun very slowly—and I believe that’s case 
even for the relatively rapid Caplan thruster.
While we’re on gigantic spacecraft, let’s move on 
to our episode on detecting gigantic spacecraft  
from the gravitational radiation they emit 
when accelerating. brothermine2292 points out  
that RAMAcraft aren't the only linear accelerators 
that would emit detectable gravitational waves. So  
would the very rare head-on collision between two 
black holes. That’s right, and we did very briefly  
mention natural causes in the video. A head-on 
collision between any compact body - black hole,  
neutron star, perhaps even white dwarfs, 
would causes both objects to massively  
decelerate in a straight line resulting in linear 
gravitational waves that could be detectable.  
For the black hole there should be a 
very weird but modellable gravitational  
wave ring-down as the two fell together 
again. For non-black holes there should  
be a really clear electromagnetic signature. 
So hopefully we can distinguish these cases.
And then there’s the episode where we talked 
about the prospects of Betelguese going supernova,  
and when the next nearby supernova 
might be, and what it might do to us.  
ETLee-db6cn points out that a portion of the 
Earth will generally be completely shadowed  
from a supernova, depending on its location in the 
sky. So while it’s true that being on the other  
side of the planet would shield you from the worst 
of the actual radiation from the supernova blast,  
for most death-by-supernova scenarios 
it’s not direct irradiation that gets you.  
The most likely killer is due to the ozone layer 
being depleted. Even if that happens only on one  
side of the planet, the effect quickly 
becomes global with atmospheric mixing.  
There’s also the fringe case when a supernova goes 
off while you’re in a region of the galaxy with  
relatively high gas abundance, which will then 
irradiate the entire planet from all direction  
with X-rays for a long time. But yeah, maybe if 
you have a well-stocked bunker and happen to be  
antipodal to a very nearby supernova, you get to 
emerge years later to enjoy the post-apocalypse.  
And by that time I might have caught up on all the 
missed comment responses, so double win really.
